"""Dataset file discovery, reading, writing and chunking utilities.

This module centralises every filesystem concern of the dataset pipeline so
that both :class:`analyzers.dataset_analyzer.DatasetAnalyzer` and
:class:`cleaning.dataset_cleaner.DatasetCleaner` use exactly the same parsing
rules and never diverge.

Design notes
------------
* Reading never raises for a single bad file: problems are collected into an
  ``errors`` list so that a multi-file run keeps going.
* Chunking is deterministic (sequential, order preserving) so that a chunk can
  always be mapped back to its exact position in the source file.  This is what
  makes a lossless reconstruction of a cleaned file possible.
